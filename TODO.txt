Consider supporting multiple bundles
    - Redo namespace or _ResourceStructure to avoid naming conflicts
    - Add check to avoid adding already added bundle

Move towards forks and CreateProcess instead of system() as it is not thread safe
 when executing commands. Although, it is better to find a more cross-platform
 solution. Otherwise it is a lot of system-dependent code.

Fix heavy test failure, or find a way of combining large output size.
